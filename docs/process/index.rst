Here are some examples of how complete DR processes might be structured,
currently to help guide development.

Multi-slit spectroscopy
=======================

This example is based on plans for the reduction of near-infrared, multi-slit
spectra, also considering future use with optical data to a lesser
extent. There may be some room for improvement based on experience.
