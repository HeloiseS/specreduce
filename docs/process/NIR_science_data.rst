Near-IR, multi-slit science data
********************************

This example is based on plans for reduction of near-infrared, multi-slit
spectra, but also shows where some alternative steps might be inserted for
optical data. Detector mosaicking is not shown here, since it is not applicable
for this instrument (to do: add this?).
